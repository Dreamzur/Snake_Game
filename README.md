# Snake Game
This is a simple snake game made on intellij but pushed through replit, therefore, the code inside this project will be optimized for replit use only.

Enjoy the :snake:!

# Work in progress
Still adding features to the game. :smile:
Currently looking to add:
- [x] Image for snake head & body
- [x] Restart game option
- [x] Game ending apples (bad apples)
- [ ] Gradual speed increase after eating apple
- [ ] More bad apples on screen

## Features needing to be fixed :wrench:
- [ ] Currently hunting for bugs :bug:

## Scrapped
- [x] Sound
  Due to replit not loading audio file, for now this feature will be scrapped
