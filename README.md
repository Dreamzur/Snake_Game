# Snake Game
A simple snake game made with Java for my final project.

Enjoy the :snake:!

## How to play

* Use WASD or Arrow keys to control the snake
* W - Up | S - Down | A - Left | D - Right
* If you lose, press SPACE to restart game

## Work in progress
  Still adding features to the game. :smile:
  Currently looking to add:
- [x] Image for snake head & body
- [x] Restart game option
- [x] Game ending apples (bad apples)
- [x] Background music
- [ ] Gradual speed increase after eating apple
- [ ] More bad apples on screen


## Features needing to be fixed :wrench:
- [ ] Currently hunting for bugs :bug:
