## 🤔 What's this?
* A simple snake game made with Java for my final project.
* The more apples you eat the higher your score will be and the bigger your snake will grow!
* Eat the bad apples and you'll lose 1 point each time.
* When you lose too much of the snake body, the game will end.

## 🎮 How to play

* Use WASD or Arrow keys to control the snake
* <code>W</code> - Up | <code>S</code> - Down | <code>A</code> - Left | <code>D</code> - Right
* If you lose, press <code>SPACE</code> to restart game
